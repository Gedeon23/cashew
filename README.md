# Cashew

**Cashew** (name not final) is a terminal user interface for [recoll](https://recoll.org).
The goal of this project is to offer a keyboard driven UI for recoll and integrate well into workflows centered around the terminal.

## Current Features

- Search recoll index
- easy keyboard driven navigation
- Detail View for each entry
- easily open the entry in your preferred pdf viewer
- Snippets View
- Open pdf at snippet location (currently only supporting zathura)

## Features Currently Working On

- flags to integrate into bash script

## Planned Features

- determine preferred document viewers
- easily open possible source files (latex, typst) in your editor 
- Surrounding Directory View


## Installation

Assuming you have Go installed on your system, the installation process is as follows.
Just clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gedeon23/cashew.git  
```

`cd` into the directory:
```
cd cashew
```

build the binary:
```
go build .
```

### Needed Applications

Right now the only requirement is recoll itself. I might add features in the future which are not accessible within the recoll cli.
