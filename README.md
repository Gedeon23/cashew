The goal of this project is to offer a keyboard driven UI for recoll and integrate well into workflows centered around the terminal.


## Current Features

- Search recoll index
- Display of Title (file name if no title is found in metadata) and Author
- easy keyboard driven navigation

## Planned Features

- Detail View for each entry
- Surrounding Directory View
- easily open the entry in your preferred pdf viewer
- easily open possible source files (latex, typst) in your editor
